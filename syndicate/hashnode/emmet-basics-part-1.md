## Tags

Basic abbreviations can be used to quickly create HTML tags.

> `div`



```html
<div></div>
```



> `p`



```html
<p></p>
```



> `h1`



```html
<h1></h1>
```



## Siblings

To create a set of HTML tags as siblings just use `+` in between each abbreviation.

> `hdr+sect+ftr`



```html
<header></header> <section></section> <footer></footer>
```



## Children

Child elements can be created by using `>` in between each abbreviation.

> `sect>ul>li`



```html
<section> <ul> <li></li> </ul> </section>
```



## Class

In order to create elements with classes just append the class to the abbreviation using `.`

> `h1.center`



```
<h1 class="center"></h1>
```



## Id

To add an Id to an element, append the Id to the abbreviation using `#`

> `h1#header`



```html
<h1 id="header"></h1>
```



## Id & Class

You can include multiple attributes on an element abbreviation.

> `h1#header.center`



```html
<h1 id="header" class="center"></h1>
```



## Content

Text content of an element can be included by wrapping the content with `{ }`

> `p{This is a paragraph.}`



```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```



## Multiply

We can create multiple elements by multiplying them using `*`

> `ul>li\*4`



```html
<ul> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> <li></li> </ul>
```
